That's the process of learning C++ during a Game development.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Topics:
    - data types: int, string, float, array, vector, map
    - structures like: struct and simple classes
    - libraries: iostream, cctype, vector, map, algorithm
    - read/write from/to file


Questions:
    Q1: What topic I'm working on?
    Q2: What I am struggling with
    Q3: What I am gonna do?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Answers:
    A1: It is clear when I need to use "passing by reference"
        but not clear yet when should I use pointers
    A2: interactive conversation with a user in CLI and/or in GUI
    A3:


# TODO: my questions from perspective of a py dev
# open questions:
- use the proper way to write classes
- connect to the database
    (https://github.com/jtv/libpqxx)
    (https://pqxx.org/libpqxx/)
- classes can be inherited as private! constructor can be virtual! how mro works
  here?
- virtual functions/methods: https://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/virtualfunctions.php
- work with for loops (why do we need to create iterators there? what benefits?)
- how to work with db, is there a standard lib or an external?
- GUI is a nightmare, need to choose the lib with nice documentation/community
- x ^= true; - toggle bool value (read about boolean operations)
