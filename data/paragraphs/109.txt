After the tournament ends, the spectators make their way to several pavilions nearby, next to the grim building — undoubtedly the Duke's residence. Walking with the select few into the residence, you see that the dining hall is located to the right of the corridor. At the same time, at the end of the same corridor, you can see a staircase leading to the second floor. So, you have a choice — accept the invitation to dinner (357) or remember your ultimate goal and seek a way forward (603).
