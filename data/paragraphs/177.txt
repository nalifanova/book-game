Your eyes behold an utterly otherworldly sight. The dining hall, once filled with nobles you were conversing with just moments ago, is now only populated by shadows and silhouettes. Everything is ghostly, unreal, including the furniture, food, and tableware. And yet, one figure, previously indistinguishable, suspiciously real and full of life—a slightly overweight, red-faced man in his thirties with aggressively curled mustaches. It's terribly strange to see this living person feasting amidst the shadows. "Who is this?" you whisper. "Ah, that's what we'll discuss," replies the duke, closing the door and locking it once more. "To pass through my duchy, you must prove yourself worthy. I propose a trial. This noble knight is a messenger of Evil, intruding into the Labyrinth with the same purpose as you. Kill him, and I will show you the way forward." What will you do? Kill an innocent man accused of serving Evil? But isn't a free person free to serve whom and what they deem necessary? Besides, they could have said the same about you, and it's simply a miracle you ended up in this room first. However, someone must die—either the duke or the stranger. What will you prefer: the first (513) or the second (309)?
