When the steps end, the outlines of an unusual carriage emerge from the darkness before you. Two lines of strange metal plates stretch into the depths of the corridor, with an incomprehensible contraption resting on them, resembling a small cart with a chair in the middle. It's impossible to bypass it, and it's better not to leave such a strange thing behind. You climb onto the carriage and settle into the chair. Immediately, a strong stream of air presses against the backrest, and your hands automatically grab the armrests. The cart starts moving at tremendous speed. The walls of the corridor fly by. Soon, you feel the path gradually turning to the left, and finally, the carriage comes to a stop. Before you is a passage illuminated by torches, leading deeper into the mountain. At the same time, the plates have not ended but continue further into the darkness. Will you rise from the chair and proceed down the corridor (121) or remain seated (348)?
