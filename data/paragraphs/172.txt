Suddenly, you notice a group of squires and armigers waiting for the tardy knight at one edge of the clearing, waving energetically at you. Descending from the ladder, you approach closer. "Oh, Sir Hugo, Sir Hugo," chides a completely unfamiliar elderly man dressed as a servant, shaking his head, "you've kept His Grace waiting." Hmm... It seems like so many people have gone mad at once... But you must respond. What will you say? Will you tell them they've mistaken you for someone else and that you're not Sir Hugo (250)? Or will you apologize for the delay and try to figure out the situation as you go along (531)?
