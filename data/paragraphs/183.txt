Having passed through the gate, you find yourself in a small cozy park that stretches along the outer wall of the Labyrinth. The wall to your right disappears, giving way to shady alleys. Here, peace and quiet reign. Directly in front of you is a small fountain surrounded by flower beds, where beautiful roses bloom. However, something makes you uneasy. Perhaps it's the strong scent that is starting to make your head spin a little? Do you want to quickly leave the flower beds and walk down one of the alleys (446), or, on the contrary, approach them (2)?
