The door opens easily. It's strange that it's not locked. You double your caution: surely the priests are relying on magic. Before you is not a sanctuary, but rather a crypt. Along the left wall is a small altar with a statue of Orr√≥ba standing on it. On the right is a tombstone without a single letter. Two items in the room pique your curiosity. The first is a diadem made of dark red stones in the hands of the goddess. The second is a `Knight's helmet` crowning the tomb. Do you want to try to take the diadem (82), the helmet (529), or will you leave (350)?
