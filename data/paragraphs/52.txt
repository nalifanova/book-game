The Duke raises his hand, calling for silence. "Today, the beginning of the tournament will be somewhat unusual. Since Sir Raul demanded apologies from Sir Hugo for the insult inflicted, and Sir Hugo refused to offer them, these respected knights have brought the resolution of their dispute here, to our court. Therefore, by the decision of both esteemed knights, the first duel of our tournament will continue until one of the participants perishes." Such luck! Now you'll have to answer for some unknown insult directed at a completely unfamiliar lord. But you can't possibly explain that you're a completely different person and that they've all made a mistake. Who knows, perhaps there's already a madhouse in this duchy. Meanwhile, the Duke lowers his hand, signaling the commencement of the duel â€” 219.
