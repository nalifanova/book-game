Within an hour, the condors deliver you to the gates of the Labyrinth. From above, it appears quite formidable and imposing: tall ancient walls, numerous "houses" and "streets," all shrouded in a strange bluish haze that prevents detailed observation. And so, the Labyrinth looms over you. It seems that the open gates are the maw of some prehistoric creature, ready to engulf yet another victim. But you must shake off the illusion and cross the threshold separating the Labyrinth from the outside world. Nothing terrible happens; you immediately encounter a wall tall enough to make it impossible to climb over. Between the outer wall and this one, there is a narrow passage leading both to the right and to the left of the gates. Which way will you go?
Right? — 210.
Left? — 486.
