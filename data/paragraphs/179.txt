It seems the woman is teasing you: at every fork in the path, she offers a glimpse of a piece of her dress so you know which way to go, but she remains elusive. After an hour of fruitless pursuit, during which you've tried to call out to her several times, the thought crosses your mind that it's time to put an end to this. Ahead lies another fork in the path. Will you turn right and try to catch up with the woman (203), turn left (611), or go back (530)?
