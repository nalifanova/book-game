As if someone's hot breath rushes through the corridor, extinguishing the torch. "Fire won't help you, human, it's powerless in the Corridor of Horror," a voice echoes, akin to the howling wind. Yes, the name of the place you've stumbled upon isn't exactly encouraging, but you still need to find out who you're dealing with. "Who are you?" "One who dwells in darkness!" Not very clear, but... "What do you want?" "I'll obtain it without your help, human. But now, no one will help you!" You feel something so inhuman and repulsive emerge from the darkness, a creation from the depths of Darkness itself, that you want to scream in horror. No sword, no magic can stop this movement, this confident, unhurried movement of Death. If you have a `ring with an amethyst` on your hand, remember it, otherwise, in a few moments, your heart won't withstand the wave of fear crashing over you, and you'll fall lifelessly to the floor of the Corridor of Horror...
