After a while, the deserted alley turns right, and you follow it. Ancient oaks rise to your right and left; the centuries-old park preserves its tranquility, but you need to hurry. However, the sight that suddenly unfolds when the trees to your right come to an end makes you forget everything. It's a golden autumn. A steep slope leads to a small stream, and on the other side, in the light morning mist, you can see a magnificent palace built in the classical styleâ€”with a balcony, two tower-like wings, and a luxurious main entrance. Trees along the slope display a variety of colors, forming an intricate pattern. Autumn? But when you entered the Labyrinth, summer was still in full swing! Has so much time passed already? There's no answer, and you descend to the stream, cross it over a wooden bridge, and then ascend again to find yourself in front of the palace entrance. From here, you can see that the stream, as it curves around the palace, disappears into the distance. Fields stretch beyond it, followed by a forest, and not far away, even a village is visible. Do you want to enter the palace (310) or head towards the village (209)?
