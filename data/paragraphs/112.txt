After rummaging through the old clutter, you find miraculously an unbroken `Mirror` (+59) and several complete costumes - `The skins and fur cap of a barbarian` (31), `A monk's robe` (396), `Knight's attire` (of course, without armor and helmet) (448), `A merchant's outfit` (292), and `A sailor's attire` (560). You can take as many as you like - just keep in mind that each costume will take up the space of two items in your shoulder bag. If you want to do this, choose the outfits you like and look at the paragraph number written in parentheses after each one. Don't close the one you're currently on. Each scene where a particular costume might come in handy will start in a paragraph whose last digit is zero. When you notice such a paragraph, you can add +25 to its number and read about which costume will help in that situation and what to do if you have it. Carefully, trying not to crease them, you pack the chosen items into your shoulder bag and open the door in the far wall of the room â€” 22.
