You follow the Duke into a spacious room adjacent to the dining hall. After closing the door behind you, he offers you a seat and removes his cloak, tossing it onto a bench in the corner. Underneath the cloak are light armor pieces that immediately catch your attention. No wonder – they bear a familiar symbol: a black letter "S" in a yellow circle. So the Duke is a Knight of the Order of the Six Words! Without showing that he noticed your surprise, the Duke sits down and starts talking. "Well, Sir Hugo, I must say it was all well played. Oh, by the way, congratulations – you've already infiltrated the second sector of the Labyrinth. I won't conceal it, the Commander is surprised by your progress." So the duel with Sir Raul was staged. But what about the servants, pages, and armigers? Were they all just pretending? As if in response to your thoughts, the Duke continues, "You know, to some extent, all these people are just products of our imagination. Here, take a look." He walks up to the wall separating the rooms from the dining hall and, inserting the key hanging from his belt into the lock, opens the door next to the one you entered through — 177.
