Without wasting any more time, you dash down the alley to catch a glimpse of the mysterious couple. Bursting onto a perpendicular path, you discover that to the right, it ends at a small gate in an ornate lattice. You catch a glimpse of a cloak's edge, the gate closes, and in the same instant, the lattice transforms into a tall, impassable wall of the Labyrinth. It's possible that this was a transition to the next sector, but no matter how hard you try, the gate does not reappear. Your only option is to continue down one of the alleys â€” 42.
