You reach for the helmet, and in the same moment, it appears on the head of the knight in blue armor who materialized from the air. A powerful elk is depicted on his coat of arms, with the motto stating, "Not noticing obstacles." "I am Viscount Elk, fallen in battle with the infidels two hundred twenty-two years ago. And my helmet shall belong only to one worthy of my glory." Hm, you've never heard anything about the exploits of Viscount Elk. However, in those times, everyone considered themselves a hero, so it's better not to argue with the self-important knight. You accept the challenge.
