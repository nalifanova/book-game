The alleyway is cool, and a gentle breeze soon makes you forget about the strong scent of roses. However, there's no time to relax—far ahead, at the end of the alley, someone's silhouette appears. At the same time, voices can be heard from behind a tall bush to your left. There must be another path there, but the dense foliage prevents you from seeing it. Two people are talking—a man and a woman. "The Great Mage... the path is almost found... the Sanctuary... the guard is bribed..."—the words reach you. Approach closer to eavesdrop on the conversation? But then the person approaching from ahead will surely notice you. Return to the flower beds and take the other path? But then you won't find out what the conversation was about. After all, they could be infiltrators of Evil in the Labyrinth. What will you choose?
Eavesdrop on the conversation? — 116.
