Trying to step silently, you approach closer to the bushes and eavesdrop on the conversation between two strangers. Now one man speaks: "So, my dear countess, it seems we have everything planned out. The path is clear now, and in the next sector, we will definitely meet again. It's time to go; the tournament is about to begin." Sounds of footsteps fading away. It would be best to run to the end of the alley and see these unknown interlocutors. But your path is blocked by a guard in armor the color of tea roses, which you recently saw. He is armed with an impressive halberd and is now standing, leaning on it. It seems he saw you eavesdropping. "What are you doing here?" the soldier asks. Will you attack him (387) or pretend to be a gardener tending to the shrubbery (217)?
