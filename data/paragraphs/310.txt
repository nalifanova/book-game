Stepping over the threshold, you find yourself in front of a wide ceremonial staircase leading to the second floor. Around you, it's echoing and empty. You cautiously and slowly ascend, finding yourself in front of a closed door on a narrow landing. It contrasts so sharply with the grandeur of the staircase that you pause, unsure which to consider the illusion. But then a tremor runs through the steps, and they reveal their true form to you—a rickety wooden staircase, from which you narrowly escaped a fall. The contradiction resolved, you open the door — 406.
