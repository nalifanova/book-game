Suddenly, somewhere ahead, you hear a sound that you least expected to hear in these underground corridors â€” a clear female laughter. Startled, you lunge forward with all your might, only to stop abruptly, realizing that it could be a trap. Moving forward quickly but cautiously, you see a fork ahead. In the left corridor, something silver flashes, resembling a dress, and the same inviting laughter echoes again. Will you turn left (179), turn right (260), or continue straight ahead (329)?
