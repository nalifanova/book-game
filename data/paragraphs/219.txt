The squire releases the reins of the horse, and it gallops heavily towards Sir Raul's steed. You feel sorry for the poor animal, but unfortunately, you can't do without armor. Besides, you're not entirely sure what to do with the spear. This is your first time in such a joust, while your opponent is surely an experienced fighter. Putting all your strength into the spear, you aim it at the spot where, according to your calculations, the knight's chest should be. Meanwhile, the armored opponent confidently charges towards you. Roll the die and see what number it lands on. If it's -1, -2, -3, or -5, go to 447; if it's -4 or -6, go to 118.
