## GAME RULES

Before embarking on your journey, you need to determine how strong, enduring, 
skilled, and charming you are as a warrior, in other words, establish your 
initial AGILITY, STRENGTH (or HP), and CHARISMA by rolling dice, and the results 
are  recorded on the Traveler's Sheet.


### AGILITY, STRENGTH (HP), and CHARISMA

**AGILITY** is the ability to wield a sword, fight, and withstand enemies. 
Sometimes it's just manual dexterity. In short, your physical capabilities. 
Naturally, the higher your Agility, the better, but it would be naive to assume 
that all adventures are designed only for the robust and daredevils. Don't be 
disappointed if your initial Agility is not as high as you would like—it's still 
plenty of other ways to win without resorting to weapons every five minutes.

**STRENGTH** (**HP**) is primarily an indicator of your current health. It 
reflects not only the presence or absence of muscles but also the will to live, 
the determination to see things through to the end. Indeed, in reality, when 
people talk about a "strong person," it's not just about a weightlifter. If your 
Strength (HP) reaches zero, you perish, and you'll have to start over.

**CHARISMA**. Often, to get somewhere, it's not necessary to use force. For 
example, to be let through, you can try to persuade, convince the interlocutor 
by telling truthful or fabricated stories. And here, checking your CHARISMA 
comes into play. If successful, know that your CHARISMA has increased by one 
unit, which will be useful next time. If it exceeds 12, further checks are 
practically meaningless. You're devilishly charming and can confidently use it. 
But the opposite is also true. If failure awaits, CHARISMA will decrease by one 
unit (which, of course, doesn't prevent it from rising again next time). 
However, if it falls to 1, further checks are once again pointless. Some people 
are so untrustworthy that no one believes them, even if they tell the absolute 
truth. From now on, until the end of the game, you become that kind of person.

Roll the dice and get your set of initial hero parameters:

| Dice  | Agility | Strength/HP | Charisma |
|:-----:|:-------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
|   2   |    8    |     22      |    8     |
|   3   |   10    |     20      |    6     |
|   4   |   12    |     16      |    5     |
|   5   |    9    |     18      |    8     |
|   6   |   11    |     20      |    6     |
|   7   |    9    |     20      |    7     |
|   8   |   10    |     16      |    7     |
|   9   |    8    |     24      |    7     |
|  10   |    9    |     22      |    6     |
|  11   |   10    |     18      |    7     |
|  12   |   11    |     20      |    5     |


### LUCK

But every adventurer also has another parameter — LUCK. Essentially, it's Fate's 
favor toward you. In a difficult journey, you'll often have to rely on the will 
of chance and rely solely on your luck.

LUCK is tested as follows. You roll two dice. If the result is less than or 
equal to your LUCK at the time of the check, then you are lucky, and everything 
turns in your favor. If the result is higher than your LUCK at the time of the 
check, then you're unlucky, and Fate will punish you for it.

All this in the book's text will be called CHECKING YOUR LUCK. Every time you 
are offered to CHECK YOUR LUCK, you must subtract 1 from your current LUCK. Soon 
you'll understand that the more you have to rely on luck, the riskier it 
becomes.

Every time you are offered to CHECK YOUR LUCK, and you don't want to or your 
LUCK is zero, consider yourself unlucky.


### REACTION

In the perilous world of the Labyrinth, a good REACTION must come to your aid. 
You'll have too little time for training, and you simply won't have time to 
perfect your REACTION, so initially it will be equal to 5. But nothing prevents 
you from training it along the way.

When you are offered to CHECK YOUR REACTION, decide whether it's worth doing. 
If you decide not to check, nothing will change, and events will continue as 
usual. Each time success will require a REACTION no lower than the predetermined 
one, but you won't know how difficult each obstacle is! If you do decide to 
check your REACTION, and everything is fine, you'll manage to defend yourself 
against imminent danger in time, and your REACTION will increase by one unit. 
If luck is not on your side, things are bad. Your REACTION will decrease by one 
unit, and you'll have to overcome upcoming difficulties at a slower pace, and 
the consequences of this could be dire. So think and decide for yourself. Just 
keep in mind that each time it will be unknown whether you can stay alive by 
overcoming the obstacle at a normal pace, or whether an exceptionally good 
reaction is required. However, it must be said that there aren't so many traps 
in the Labyrinth.


### BATTLES / FIGHTS

Throughout the pages of the book, you'll often encounter enemies that you'll 
have to fight. If there's no way to avoid it or if you don't want to, follow 
these steps:

First, write down the AGILITY and STRENGTH of your enemy on a piece of paper. 
Now, fight:

- **Action 1**: Roll both dice for your enemy. Add their AGILITY to this. 
    The sum will show their ATTACK STRENGTH.

- **Action 2**: Roll both dice for yourself and add to this the AGILITY you 
    have at the moment of the fight. This is your ATTACK STRENGTH.

- **Action 3**: If your ATTACK STRENGTH is greater than your enemy's, you manage 
    to wound them. See action 4. If it's the other way around, they wound you. 
    See *action 5*. If they are equal, they parry your attack, and you continue 
    the fight. See *action 1*.

- **Action 4**: You wounded your enemy. Subtract two from their STRENGTH.

- **Action 5**: You're wounded. Subtract two from your STRENGTH.

- **Action 6**: Write down the new STRENGTH value for either you or your 
    opponent.

- **Action 7**: Now continue fighting (see action 1) until either your or your 
    opponent's STRENGTH becomes zero. This means death. If you reduce your 
    opponent's STRENGTH to zero, you win, and they are killed. If they manage 
    to defeat you, the journey is over. You'll have to start the game again.

In some specifically stated cases, you'll be given the opportunity to flee the 
battlefield. Follow the instructions in the book, but keep in mind that in the 
event of your escape, the final blow remains with the enemy, and you must 
automatically subtract 2 STRENGTH from yourself.


### BATTLE WITH MULTIPLE OPPONENTS

If you have to fight not with one, but with several enemies at once, then before 
each attack round, you must choose whom you're directing your blow towards. Roll 
the dice for each participant in the battle. With your chosen opponent, you 
fight as usual, but in addition, you must compare your ATTACK STRENGTH with the 
ATTACK STRENGTH of all other enemies. For each enemy whose ATTACK STRENGTH is 
greater than yours, they wound you. However, you can only wound your immediate 
opponent, even if your ATTACK STRENGTH is greater than all others.

### EQUIPMENT AND FINDINGS

As will be mentioned shortly, before embarking on the journey, you're given FOOD 
for three days. Each FOOD can restore 4 STRENGTH (HP). You can eat at any time 
you feel hungry, without waiting for a special invitation. But never during a 
battle! Your opponents won't be so easy to deal with if you're fighting with a 
full mouth.

For food, as well as anything else you find or acquire along the way, you'll 
have a shoulder bag. However, it's not bottomless - it can only hold up to seven 
items. If the bag becomes full and you want to take something else with you, 
you'll have to empty something out. But don't worry: not everything you find 
will be useful on the journey.

Of course, not everything is worth carrying on your back. For example, a sword 
would be in its scabbard. But any other weapon can only be taken with you if 
specifically stated - you probably can't fit a spear into your shoulder bag, for 
instance. On the other hand, you can wear an amulet around your neck.

### And lastly 
Reading the book straight through is pointless. It will only confuse you, and 
then you might make the wrong decision at a critical moment. Look at only those 
numbers and in the sequence in which the book presents them, because ultimately, 
IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU!
